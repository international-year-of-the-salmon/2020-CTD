### Notes

### Changed 
Updated standardized data so the station names of the CTD casts match are now the same as the trawl set number that the CTD cast is associated with. Original CTD station names included numbers and letters eg. station 1, 2, P, AB. Trawls were not assigned the same stations in the bridgelog only a set number. The CTD and Rosette staion numbers don't match with the trawl set numbers, so we retained the original CTD/Rosette station name in a column called 'alternate_station_id' but changed station to match the trawl set number so that future bottle samples can be matched to either the trawl or the CTD/Rosette station. The cross walk for trawl set number and CTD/Rosette station number was found in a table called 'UBC Trawl sample data_dec2020' in this google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1etM9o4ZKfNHDdDRPeAvsMK5j6NNPqrgHGDsdbC3m3Is/edit#gid=1300978020
